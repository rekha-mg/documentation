- We have defined a function, mixedNumbers, which we are passing an array as an argument. Modify the function by using push() and unshift() to add 'I', 2, 'three' to the beginning of the array and 7, 'VIII', 9 to the end so that the returned array contains representations of the numbers 1-9 in order.
```
function mixedNumbers(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
arr.unshift('I',2,'three');
arr.push(7,'VIII',9);
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

console.log(mixedNumbers(['IV', 5, 'six']));
```

#### Remove Items Using splice()
- splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of the array that splice() is being called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so to indicate the first element of an array, we would use 0.
- splice()'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example:
```
let array = ['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'];

array.splice(2, 2);
// remove 2 elements beginning with the 3rd element
// array now equals ['today', 'was', 'great']
```

#### Add Items Using splice()
- Remember in the last challenge we mentioned that splice() can take up to three parameters? Well, you can use the third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add to the array. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another.
```
const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
const startIndex = 3;
const amountToDelete = 1;

numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
// the second entry of 12 is removed, and we add 13 and 14 at the same index
console.log(numbers);
// returns [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ]
```

#### Copy Array Items Using slice()
- The next method we will cover is slice(). Rather than modifying an array, slice() copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched.
-  slice() takes only 2 parameters â€” the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). Consider this:
```
let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];

let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
// todaysWeather equals ['snow', 'sleet'];
// weatherConditions still equals ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear']
```

#### Functional Programming: Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array
- The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.

- When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was called.

- See below for an example using the map method on the users array to return a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.
```
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const names = users.map(user => user.name);
console.log(names); // [ 'John', 'Amy', 'camperCat' ]
```

```  mapped 2 maps from array (title and rating)
const ratings = watchList.map(item => ({
  title: item["Title"],
  rating: item["imdbRating"]
}));
```

#### Functional Programming: Implement map on a Prototype

```
Write your own Array.prototype.myMap(), which should behave exactly like Array.prototype.map(). You may use a for loop or the forEach method.

Passed
new_s should equal [46, 130, 196, 10].
Passed
Your code should not use the map method.

var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myMap = function(callback){
  var newArray = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  //this.forEach(a => newArray.push(callback(a)));//or this code
for (let i=0;i<this.length;i++){
 newArray.push(callback(this[i]));     
  }
  return newArray;
};

var new_s = s.myMap(function(item){
  return item * 2;
});
```

#### Functional Programming: Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array

The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use a combination of filter and map on watchList to assign a new array of objects with only title and rating keys. The new array should only include objects where imdbRating is greater than or equal to 8.0. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and you may need to convert them into numbers to perform mathematical operations on them.

```
// Only change code below this line
var filteredList = watchList
  .map(movie => {
    return {
      title: movie.Title,
      rating: movie.imdbRating
    };
  })
  .filter(movie => {
    // return true it will keep the item
    // return false it will reject the item
    return parseFloat(movie.rating) >= 8.0;
  });

// Only change code above this line

console.log(filteredList);
```

#### Functional Programming: Use the reduce Method to Analyze Data
```
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const sumOfAges = users.reduce((sum, user) => sum + user.age, 0);
console.log(sumOfAges); // 64
```

#### Functional Programming: Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method
```
function alphabeticalOrder(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a === b ? 0 : a < b ? -1 : 1;
  });

  // Only change code above this line
}
alphabeticalOrder(["a", "d", "c", "a", "z", "g"]);
```
