### Transaction 
- A transaction is an action or series of actions that are being performed by a single user or application program, which reads or updates the contents of the database.

- A transaction can be defined as a logical unit of work on the database. This may be an entire program, a piece of a program, or a single command (like the SQL commands such as INSERT or UPDATE), and it may engage in any number of operations on the database. In the database context, the execution of an application program can be thought of as one or more transactions with non-database processing taking place in between.
