#### JavaScript
- JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project), the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.
- Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the var (less recommended, dive deeper for the explanation) or the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
- After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
        myVariable = 'Bob';
- Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:
        let myVariable = 'Bob';
- You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:
        myVariable;
- After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:
        let myVariable = 'Bob';
        myVariable = 'Steve';
