* Agile focuses on keeping the process lean and creating minimum viable products (MVPs) that go through a number of iterations before anything is final. Feedback is gathered and implemented continually and in all, it is a much more dynamic process where everyone is working together towards one goal.

 * Agile is a mindset which is all about transparency, inspection and adaptation. 
 * Agile however doesn’t consist of any roles, events or artifacts. It’s a mindset.
