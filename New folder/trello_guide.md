###Trello 
Trello is used by teams and organizations of all sizes, 
from freelancers to enterprises, schools and non-profits.
###Create A Board
* Boards are where projects get organized,
  information is shared, and great work happens.
  
* Boards are made up of lists and cards. Lists often
  represent a workflow or process. Cards, which often
  represent tasks, move across these lists to completion.
  
* From the team’s Boards tab, click “Create new board” or
  click the plus button (+) in the Trello header directly 
  to the left of your name, and select “Create Board.”
  Name the board for whatever you are working on.
  (Remember: It can be anything from organizing an 
   event or managing a blog, to tracking sales leads
   or planning that much needed vacation.)
###Add Lists
* Click "Add a list" to add your first list to your 
  board, such as "To Do." List names can be as simple 
  as steps like “To Do,” “Doing,” and “Done” or as
  detailed as needed for the work you are doing.
  Add as many lists to your board as you need to 
   build out a workflow.
###Add Cards
  * Add cards for each task that needs to be completed 
   by clicking “Add A Card” in the first list. 
   Keep card titles short to make it easier to scan and
   see the status of each card on the board. So that 
   everyone has a clear understanding of what needs to 
   get done, click on cards to add more information 
   such as:
  * Due dates
  * Descriptions
  * Checklists
  * Attachments
  * Comments
###   Invite Members
* Invite members to your board so that they can be assigned 
to tasks and collaborate on your board. Click “Invite” in
 the board’s menu and select members of your team to add 
 to your board, or invite members by their email address 
 or name.

###What do people dislike about Trello?
* Fails for high-level management.
* Navigation is sometime awkward.
* Somebody leaves the company 
and I have zero control over their account.
* #####Too simple for deeper collaboration: Trello 
  is great for sorting personal to dos and simple
  collaboration. However once your team exceeds 
  15 people, it becomes very easy to outgrow Trello. 
  It lacks some critical task management features like
  Tasks in multiple projects, timeline, assigning 
  checklist items separately etc.
 * #####Reliant on integrations: 
   Trello intentionally keeps its core features very 
   limited. It offers integrations with different apps 
   to make up for it. The problem with integrations is 
   that they can never be completely seamless. On top of 
   that, they cost extra.
